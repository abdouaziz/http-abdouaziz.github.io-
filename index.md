# About me

I'm currently working at [Openfield](http://openfieldlive.com/?lang=en) in Paris, as a full-time **Machine-Learning R&D Engineer**, since June 2018.

---


*As a problem-solving enthusiast, I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges, where I can learn some new things and feed my curiosity.  
I got myself into Data Science early in my education and had the chance to get my hands on all kinds of data, from sequential to spatial, images, audio signals, BI data etc.  
As an R&D Engineer, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills, tackle original problems and learn every day.*
